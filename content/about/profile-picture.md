## How do I change my Profile Picture?

Starting from July 1, 2021 WireFact has changed it's policy with regards to User Profile Picture. This has been done to encourage a more globally acceptable profile picture for the users so that any posts and/or comments in public sections are more globally recognizable. Due to this, we now encourage all users to instead, use their Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar). WireFact no longer allows you to change and/or store your profile picture on WireFact and all changes made to your gravatar are instantly reflected on your WireFact account.

## What is a Gravatar?

Gravatars are a public, open and responsible image-based identity for you. You can create a gravatar and/or change your existing gravatar from the official site -
https://en.gravatar.com/

## How does WireFact link to my Gravatar?

WireFact uses the Gravatar that is linked to your primary email. Currently, there is no option to alter this behaviour in any manner. However, we do recognize the security threat and look to introduce options to allow restricted modifications this behaviour.

## Is this secure?

Yes. The Gravatar URL linked to your primary email is hashed and therefore is not directly traceable to your primary email.
