# About WireFact

WireFact was created and is maintained by a group of friends who wanted a free and open-source medium to share their stories. You can't put a price on knowledge and we intend to keep WireFact free and transparent to all it's users. We are working on several features that will not only help you express yourself but also to spread the message across several social media platforms so your article gets the exposure it needs to reach your target audience. We do however, strongly object to sharing false and/or misleading information so if any article is based on real and/or factually verifiable statements, we will make an effort to verify them. We do not want our readers to fall victim to false pretenses and/or claims. We hope you enjoy your time on WireFact.
