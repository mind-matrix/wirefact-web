    index: `<h1 id="about-wirefact">About WireFact</h1>
    <p>WireFact was created and is maintained by a group of friends who wanted a free and open-source medium to share their stories. You can&#39;t put a price on knowledge and we intend to keep WireFact free and transparent to all it&#39;s users. We are working on several features that will not only help you express yourself but also to spread the message across several social media platforms so your article gets the exposure it needs to reach your target audience. We do however, strongly object to sharing false and/or misleading information so if any article is based on real and/or factually verifiable statements, we will make an effort to verify them. We do not want our readers to fall victim to false pretenses and/or claims. We hope you enjoy your time on WireFact.</p>

    changes: `<h1 id="a-new-wirefact">A New WireFact</h1>
    <p>For those of you returning from the old WireFact Platform. There are a lot of exciting new changes for you to take a look -</p>
    <p>Let&#39;s first get the bad stuff out of the way -</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Gallery</strong>: Each user can now upload only up to 100 MB of image content to their gallery. This helps us conserve resources to provide a better overall experience on the platform. We do hope to increase this cap in future with continued support from our sponsors and the community.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>Now the good stuff -</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>SEO</strong>: The new WireFact platform boasts highly SEO-friendly post pages that we will continue to improve over time. This means your readers can find your content on the internet more easily than before.</li>
    <li><strong>Twitter Direct</strong>: All new posts will be almost instantly published on Twitter (no more delays!) and will get the exposure they need on time to connect to the desired audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Narration</strong>: Selective Posts can now get narration activated on them. Narration enables readers to opt for an audiobook-like narrative experience of your post content.</li>
    <li><strong>AutoGen (ALPHA)</strong>: AutoGen is a set of tools that will help you write your posts faster, assisting you with all kinds of chore-like tasks (ex. declaring topics, finding relevant hashtags, etc.). Try it out for yourself!</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: You can now see analytics about your Posts on your Dashboard.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy Interface</strong>: No more complicated SEO settings for making your post more accessible on the internet. Just write your post, write an excerpt (or have AutoGen write it for you!) and hit PUBLISH! We&#39;ll take care of the rest 😊.</li>
    </ul>`,
    media: `<h1 id="media-storage-policy">Media Storage Policy</h1>
    <p>Starting from July 1, 2021 we have introduced a new storage policy that segregates user storage space. Previously, we used a different service provider who used a shared storage space for all user media. Since our shift to the new platform, we have decided to assign separate storage spaces for every user. As such, we can provide faster and a more secure experience in dealing with images, audios, videos, etc. on WireFact. However, we have introduced a limit to the maximum storage space allotted per user. Currently, it is set to 100 MB. We do intend to increase this cap eventually but in order to do so, we need the support of our donors and community. Kindly consider joining us on social media or donating however much you see fit to our fund.</p>`,
    "profile-picture": `<h2 id="how-do-i-change-my-profile-picture-">How do I change my Profile Picture?</h2>
    <p>Starting from July 1, 2021 WireFact has changed it&#39;s policy with regards to User Profile Picture. This has been done to encourage a more globally acceptable profile picture for the users so that any posts and/or comments in public sections are more globally recognizable. Due to this, we now encourage all users to instead, use their Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar). WireFact no longer allows you to change and/or store your profile picture on WireFact and all changes made to your gravatar are instantly reflected on your WireFact account.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-gravatar-">What is a Gravatar?</h2>
    <p>Gravatars are a public, open and responsible image-based identity for you. You can create a gravatar and/or change your existing gravatar from the official site -
    <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">https://en.gravatar.com/</a></p>
    <h2 id="how-does-wirefact-link-to-my-gravatar-">How does WireFact link to my Gravatar?</h2>
    <p>WireFact uses the Gravatar that is linked to your primary email. Currently, there is no option to alter this behaviour in any manner. However, we do recognize the security threat and look to introduce options to allow restricted modifications this behaviour.</p>
    <h2 id="is-this-secure-">Is this secure?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The Gravatar URL linked to your primary email is hashed and therefore is not directly traceable to your primary email.</p>`,
